# CAESAR CIPHER PROJECT

# You just got a message from your pen pal Vishal!
'''
Hey there! How have you been? I've been great! I just learned about this really cool type of cipher called a Caesar Cipher. 
Here's how it works: You take your message, something like "hello" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. 
For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of "hello", I would encode my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left with respect to the alphabet. 
So "h" becomes "e", "e" becomes "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then I have my encoded message, "ebiil"! 
Now I can send you my message and the offset and you can decode it by shifting each letter 3 places to the right. 
The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher! Isn't that so cool! 
Okay, now I'm going to send you a longer encoded message that you have to decode yourself!

This message has an offset of 10. Can you decode it?

def coded_message(coded_message, offset):
  solved_cipher = ''
  for letter in coded_message:
    if not (letter in alphabet):
      solved_cipher += letter
    else:
      location = alphabet.find(letter)
      letter_position = (location + offset) % 26
      new_letter = alphabet[letter_position]
      solved_cipher += new_letter
  return solved_cipher
  
print(coded_message(message, 10))

# Prints: hey there! this is an example of a caesar cipher. were you able to decode it? i hope so! send me a message back with the same offset!


reverse_message = 'it must be fun to send coded messages!'
print(coded_message(reverse_message, 10))

# Prints: sd wecd lo pex dy coxn mynon wocckqoc!


# Vishal sent over another reply, this time with two coded messages!
# Okay here are two more messages, the first one is coded just like before with an offset of ten, and it contains a hint for decoding the second message!
# First message: jxu evviuj veh jxu iusedt cuiiqwu yi vekhjuud. 
# Second message: bqdradyuzs ygxfubxq omqemd oubtqde fa oapq kagd yqeemsqe ue qhqz yadq eqogdq!

first_message = 'jxu evviuj veh jxu iusedt cuiiqwu yi vekhjuud.'
print(coded_message(first_message, 10))

# Prints: the offset for the second message is fourteen.


second_message = 'bqdradyuzs ygxfubxq omqemd oubtqde fa oapq kagd yqeemsqe ue qhqz yadq eqogdq!'
print(coded_message(second_message, 14))

# Prints: performing multiple caesar ciphers to code your messages is even more secure!
