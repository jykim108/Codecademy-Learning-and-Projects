import codecademylib3

# Import pandas with alias
import pandas as pd

# Import dataset as a Pandas dataframe
movies = pd.read_csv("netflix_movies.csv", index_col=0)

# The movies dataframe is composed of the television shows and movies hosted on the Netflix platform in 2019. 
# Print the first five rows of the dataframe using the .head() method.
# View the first five rows of the dataframe
print(movies.head())

# The rating variable describes the Motion Picture Association Film Rating Board rating for each film \
and the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board rating for each television show. 
# We have consolidated the ratings for simplicity.
# Inspect the first five rows that were just printed out from the .head() method. 
# Identify whether the rating variable is quantitative or categorical and assign the value of 'numerical' or 'categorical' to a variable called rating_variable_type.

rating_variable_type = 'categorical'


# CATEGORICAL VARIABLES
# View the first five rows of the dataframe
print(movies.head())


# Print the unique values of the country column to assess its variable type.
print(movies['country'].unique())

# Identify whether the country column is ordinal or nominal and assign the value of country_variable_type to either 'ordinal', 'nominal', or 'binary'.
country_variable_type = 'nominal'
