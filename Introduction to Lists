# Comprehensive List Practice, including creating lists, modifying elements, adding/removing elements, and creating/modifying 2-D lists

# Maria is entering customer data for her web store business. We’re going to help her organize her data. 
# Start by turning this list of customer first names into a list called first_names. Make sure to enter the names in this order: Ainsley, Ben, Chani, Depak

first_names = ['Ainsley', 'Ben', 'Chani', 'Depak']


# Maria wants to track all customer’s preferred sizes for her clothing. Create a list called preferred_size.
# Fill our new list preferred_size with the following data, containing the preferred sizes for Ainsley, Ben, and Chani: ["Small", "Large", "Medium"]

preferred_size = ['Small', 'Large', 'Medium']


# Oh no! We forgot to add Depak’s size.
# Depak’s size is "Medium". Use .append() to add "Medium" to the preferred_size list.
# Print preferred_size to see our change.

preferred_size.append('Medium')
print(preferred_size)

# Prints: ['Small', 'Large', 'Medium', 'Medium']



# Maria is having a hard time visualizing which customer is associated with each size. Let’s restructure our two lists into a two-dimensional list to help Maria.
# In addition to our already available data, Maria is adding a third value for each customer that reflects if they want expedited shipping on their orders.
# This will be reflected using a boolean value (True for expedited, False for regular)
# Create a two-dimensional list called customer_data using the following table as a reference for the data. 
# Each sublist should contain a name, size, and expedited shipping option for a single person.
# Print customer_data to see the data.
'''
Name	Size	Expedited Shipping
"Ainsley"	"Small"	True
"Ben"	"Large"	False
"Chani"	"Medium"	True
"Depak"	"Medium"	False
'''


customer_data = [['Ainsley', 'Small', True], ['Ben', 'Large', False], ['Chani', 'Medium', True], ['Depak', 'Medium', False]]
print(customer_data)

# Prints: [['Ainsley', 'Small', True], ['Ben', 'Large', False], ['Chani', 'Medium', True], ['Depak', 'Medium', False]]


# "Chani" reached out to Maria. She requested to switch to regular shipping to save some money.
# Change the data value for "Chani"‘s shipping preference to False in our two-dimensional list to reflect the change.

customer_data[2][2] = False


# "Ben" reached out to Maria asking to remove his shipping option because he is not sure what type he wants.
# Use the .remove() method to delete the shipping value from the sublist that contains ben’s data.

customer_data[1].remove(False)
print(customer_data)

# Prints: [['Ainsley', 'Small', True], ['Ben', 'Large'], ['Chani', 'Medium', False], ['Depak', 'Medium', False]]


# Great job making it this far! One last thing, Maria received new customers, "Amit" and "Karim", the following 2d list contains their data:
# [["Amit", "Large", True], ["Karim", "X-Large", False]]
# Create a new variable customer_data_final. Combine our existing list customer_data with our new customer 2d list using + by adding it to the end of customer_data.
# Print customer_data_final to see our final result.

customer_data_final = customer_data + [['Amit', 'Large', True], ['Karim', 'X-Large', False]]
print(customer_data_final)

# Prints: [['Ainsley', 'Small', True], ['Ben', 'Large'], ['Chani', 'Medium', False], ['Depak', 'Medium', False], ['Amit', 'Large', True], ['Karim', 'X-Large', False]]
