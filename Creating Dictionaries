# CREATING DICTIONARIES

# ADD A KEY
# To add a single key: value pair to a dictionary, we can use the syntax: dictionary[key] = value

# Create an empty dictionary called animals_in_zoo.
# Walking around the zoo, you see 8 zebras. Add "zebras" to animals_in_zoo as a key with a value of 8.
# The primate house was bananas! Add "monkeys" to animals_in_zoo as a key with a value of 12.

animals_in_zoo = {}

animals_in_zoo['zebras'] = 8
animals_in_zoo['monkeys'] = 12


# As you leave the zoo, you are saddened that you did not see any dinosaurs. Add "dinosaurs" to animals_in_zoo as a key with a value of 0.
# Print animals_in_zoo.

animals_in_zoo['dinosaurs'] = 0
print(animals_in_zoo)

# Prints: {'zebras': 8, 'monkeys': 12, 'dinosaurs': 0}



# ADDING MULTIPLE KEYS
# If we wanted to add multiple key : value pairs to a dictionary at once, we can use the .update() method.

user_ids = {"teraCoder": 9018293, "proProgrammer": 119238}

# In one line of code, add two new users to the user_ids dictionary:
'''
theLooper, with an id of 138475
stringQueen, with an id of 85739
'''

user_ids.update({'theLooper': 138475, 'stringQueen': 85739})
print(user_ids)

# Prints: {'teraCoder': 9018293, 'proProgrammer': 119238, 'theLooper': 138475, 'stringQueen': 85739}


# OVERWRITING VALUES

oscar_winners = {"Best Picture": "La La Land", "Best Actor": "Casey Affleck", "Best Actress": "Emma Stone", "Animated Feature": "Zootopia"}

# Add the key "Supporting Actress" and set the value to "Viola Davis".
# Without changing the definition of the dictionary oscar_winners, change the value associated with the key "Best Picture" to "Moonlight".

oscar_winners['Supporting Actress'] = 'Viola Davis'
oscar_winners['Best Picture'] = 'Moonlight'
print(oscar_winners)

# Prints: {'Best Picture': 'Moonlight', 'Best Actor': 'Casey Affleck', 'Best Actress': 'Emma Stone', 'Animated Feature': 'Zootopia', 'Supporting Actress': 'Viola Davis'}


# DICT COMPREHENSIONS
# Let’s say we have two lists that we want to combine into a dictionary, like a list of students and a list of their heights, in inches:
'''
names = ['Jenny', 'Alexus', 'Sam', 'Grace']
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
'''
# Python allows you to create a dictionary using a dict comprehension, with this syntax: students = {key:value for key, value in zip(names, heights)}

# You have two lists, representing some drinks sold at a coffee shop and the milligrams of caffeine in each.
# First, create a variable called zipped_drinks that is an iterator of pairs between the drinks list and the caffeine list.
# Create a dictionary called drinks_to_caffeine by using a dict comprehension that goes through the zipped_drinks iterator and turns each tuple pair into a key:value item.

drinks = ["espresso", "chai", "decaf", "drip"]
caffeine = [64, 40, 0, 120]

zipped_drinks = zip(drinks, caffeine)

drinks_to_caffeine = {key:value for key, value in zipped_drinks}
print(drinks_to_caffeine)

# Prints: {'espresso': 64, 'chai': 40, 'decaf': 0, 'drip': 120}


# REVIEW
# We are building a music streaming service. We have provided two lists, representing songs in a user’s library and the amount of times each song has been played.
# Using a dict comprehension, create a dictionary called plays that goes through zip(songs, playcounts) and creates a song:playcount pair for each song in songs and each playcount in playcounts.
# Print plays.

songs = ["Like a Rolling Stone", "Satisfaction", "Imagine", "What's Going On", "Respect", "Good Vibrations"]
playcounts = [78, 29, 44, 21, 89, 5]

plays = {key:value for key, value in zip(songs, playcounts)}
print(plays)

# Prints: {'Like a Rolling Stone': 78, 'Satisfaction': 29, 'Imagine': 44, "What's Going On": 21, 'Respect': 89, 'Good Vibrations': 5}


# After printing plays, add a new entry to it. The entry should be for the song "Purple Haze" and the playcount is 1.
# This user has caught Aretha Franklin fever and listened to “Respect” 5 more times. Update the value for "Respect" to be 94 in the plays dictionary.

plays['Purple Haze'] = 1
plays['Respect'] = 94


# Create a dictionary called library that has two key: value pairs:
# key "The Best Songs" with a value of plays, the dictionary you created
# key "Sunday Feelings" with a value of an empty dictionary
# Print library.

library = {'The Best Songs': plays, 'Sunday Feelings': {}}
print(library)

# Prints: {'The Best Songs': {'Like a Rolling Stone': 78, 'Satisfaction': 29, 'Imagine': 44, "What's Going On": 21, 'Respect': 94, 'Good Vibrations': 5, 'Purple Haze': 1}, 'Sunday Feelings': {}}
