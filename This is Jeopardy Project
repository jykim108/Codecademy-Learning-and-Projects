# This Is Jeopardy!

# Project Goals
# You will work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of Jeopardy! questions and answers. 
# Filter the dataset for topics that you’re interested in, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion!

import pandas as pd
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)


# We’ve provided a csv file containing data about the game show Jeopardy! in a file named jeopardy.csv.
# Load the data into a DataFrame and investigate its contents. Try to print out specific columns.

df = pd.read_csv('jeopardy.csv')

print(df.head(10))

for col in df:
  print(col)

# Columns are: Show Number, Air Date, Round, Category, Value, Question, Answer
df.rename(columns={
  'Show Number': 'show_number',
  ' Air Date': 'air_date',
  ' Round': 'round',
  ' Category': 'category',
  ' Value': 'value',
  ' Question': 'question',
  ' Answer': 'answer'}, inplace=True)


# Write a function that filters the dataset for questions that contains all of the words in a list of words. 
# For example, when the list ["King", "England"] was passed to our function, the function returned a DataFrame of 152 rows. 
# Every row had the strings "King" and "England" somewhere in its " Question".

def find_word(data, phrase):
  filter_word = lambda x: all(word.lower() in x.lower().split() for word in phrase)
  return data.loc[data['question'].apply(filter_word)]
