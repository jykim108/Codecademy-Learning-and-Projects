# First, let’s take a look at the three lists in script.py:
# names stores the names of seven individuals.
# estimated_insurance_costs stores the estimated medical insurance costs for the individuals.
# actual_insurance_costs stores the actual insurance costs paid by the individuals.
# We want to calculate the average insurance cost each person paid. We’ll start by adding up all of the insurance costs

# Create a variable total_cost and initialize it to 0.
# Use a for loop to iterate through actual_insurance_costs and add each insurance cost to the variable total_cost.

total_cost = 0
for cost in actual_insurance_costs:
  total_cost += cost
  
  
# After the for loop, create a variable called average_cost that stores the total_cost divided by the length of the actual_insurance_costs list.  
# Print average_cost with the following message:
# Average Insurance Cost: <average_cost> dollars.

average_cost = total_cost / len(actual_insurance_costs)
print("Average Insurance Cost: " + str(average_cost) + " dollars.")

# Prints: Average Insurance Cost: 4400.0 dollars.


# For each individual in names, we want to determine whether their insurance cost is above or below average.
# Write a for loop with variable i that goes from 0 to len(names).
# Inside of the for loop, do the following:
# Create a variable name, which stores names[i].
# Create a variable insurance_cost, which stores actual_insurance_costs[i].
# Print out the insurance cost for each individual, with the following message:
# The insurance cost for <name> is <insurance_cost> dollars.

# If you look closely at actual_insurance_costs and estimated_insurance_costs, you will notice that each of the actual insurance costs are 10% higher than the estimated insurance costs.
# Using a list comprehension, create a new list called updated_estimated_costs, which has each element in estimated_insurance_costs multiplied by 11/10.
# Print updated_estimated_costs. You should see that the list now looks the same as actual_insurance_costs.
