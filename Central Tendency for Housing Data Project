# SUMMARY STATISTICS

# In this project, you will find the mean, median, and mode cost of one-bedroom apartments in three of the five New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.
# Using your findings, you will make conclusions about the cost of living in each of the boroughs. 
# We will also discuss an important assumption that we make when we point out differences between the boroughs.

# We’ve imported data about one-bedroom apartments in three of New York City’s boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. We saved the values to:
brooklyn_one_bed
manhattan_one_bed
queens_one_bed
# In this project, we only care about the price of apartments, so we saved the price of apartments in each borough to:
brooklyn_price
manhattan_price
queens_price
# If you want to see what these arrays look like, you can use print statements to see them in the output terminal.
