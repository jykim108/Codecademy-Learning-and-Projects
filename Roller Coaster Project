# MATPLOTLIB CHALLENGE PROJECT

# Roller coasters are thrilling amusement park rides designed to make you squeal and scream! 
# They take you up high, drop you to the ground quickly, and sometimes even spin you upside down before returning to a stop.
# Today you will be taking control back from the roller coasters and visualizing data covering international roller coaster rankings and roller coaster statistics.
# Roller coasters are often split into two main categories based on their construction material: wood or steel. 
# Rankings for the best wood and steel roller coasters from the 2013 to 2018 Golden Ticket Awards are provided.
# Load each csv into a DataFrame and inspect it to gain familiarity with the data.
