# SUMMARY STATISTICS

# You’re planning a trip to London and want to get a sense of the best time of the year to visit. 
# Luckily, you got your hands on a dataset from 2015 that contains over 39,000 data points about weather conditions in London. 
# Surely, with this much information, you can discover something useful about when to make your trip!

import codecademylib3_seaborn

# All of the weather data is stored in a variable named london_data.
# Print the first few rows of the dataset by calling print(london_data.head()).
# Take a look at the browser to see the columns of this dataset. Here are two questions to ask yourself:
# How often were measurements taken? Which columns might be the most useful when thinking about planning a trip.

# By looking at the mean and standard deviation of the temperature in London during each month of the year, we can get a sense of the best time to visit.
# Looking at the spread of the data is an important statistic to consider if you are particularly sensitive to extreme days. 
# For example, if you pick a month with a large standard deviation, you might have one day that is relatively cold while the following day is very hot.
# Take some time to see if you can find more insights in this dataset. Here are some ideas we have for you:

# Look at columns other than "TemperatureC". Can you find something interesting about the humidity or the air pressure? Can you find the rainiest month? 
# Filter based on"hour". Similar to how you filtered based on the month, are there certain hours that have higher variance than others?
