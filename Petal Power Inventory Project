# You’re the lead data analyst for a chain of gardening stores called Petal Power. Help them analyze their inventory!
# Data for all of the locations of Petal Power is in the file inventory.csv. Load the data into a DataFrame called inventory.

import pandas as pd

inventory = pd.read_csv('inventory.csv')


# Inspect the first 10 rows of inventory.
# The first 10 rows represent data from your Staten Island location. Select these rows and save them to staten_island.
staten_island = inventory.head(10)


# A customer just emailed you asking what products are sold at your Staten Island location. 
# Select the column product_description from staten_island and save it to the variable product_request.
product_request = staten_island.product_description


# Another customer emails to ask what types of seeds are sold at the Brooklyn location.
# Select all rows where location is equal to Brooklyn and product_type is equal to seeds and save them to the variable seed_request.
seed_request = inventory[(inventory.location == 'Brooklyn') & (inventory.product_type == 'seeds')]


# Add a column to inventory called in_stock which is True if quantity is greater than 0 and False if quantity equals 0.
in_stock = lambda row: 'True' if row['quantity'] > 0 else 'False'

# Petal Power wants to know how valuable their current inventory is.
# Create a column called total_value that is equal to price multiplied by quantity.

# The following lambda function combines product_type and product_description into a single string:

                     row.product_description)
                     
# Using combine_lambda, create a new column in inventory called full_description that has the complete description of each product.

inventory['full_description'] = inventory.apply(combine_lambda, axis=1)
