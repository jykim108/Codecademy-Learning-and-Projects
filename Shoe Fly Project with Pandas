# ShoeFly Data Analyst Project

# In this example, you’ll be the data analyst for ShoeFly.com, a fictional online shoe store. You’ve seen this data; now it’s your turn to work with it!
# Load the data from shoefly.csv into the variable orders.

import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

orders = pd.read_csv('shoefly.csv')

# Inspect the first 5 lines of the data.
print(orders.head())

# Select all of the email addresses from the column email and save them to a variable called emails.

emails = orders.email

# Frances Palmer claims that her order was wrong. What did Frances Palmer order?
# Use logic to select that row of orders and save it to the variable frances_palmer.

frances_palmer = orders[(orders.first_name == 'Frances') & (orders.last_name == 'Palmer')]

# We need some customer reviews for our comfortable shoes. 
# Select all orders for shoe_type: clogs, boots, and ballet flats and save them to the variable comfy_shoes.

comfy_shoes = orders[orders.shoe_type.isin(['clogs', 'boots', 'ballet flats'])]


# More messy order data has been loaded into the variable orders. Examine the first 5 rows of the data using print and .head().
print(orders.head())

# Many of our customers want to buy vegan shoes (shoes made from materials that do not come from animals). 
# Add a new column called shoe_source, which is vegan if the materials is not leather and animal otherwise.

mylambda = lambda x: 'vegan' if x != 'leather' else 'animal'
orders['shoe_source'] = orders.shoe_material.apply(mylambda)

# Our marketing department wants to send out an email to each customer. 
# Using the columns last_name and gender create a column called salutation which contains Dear Mr. <last_name> for men and Dear Ms. <last_name> for women.

gender_lambda = lambda row: 'Dear Mr. ' + row['last_name'] if row['gender'] == 'male' else 'Dear Ms. ' + row['last_name']
orders['salutation'] = orders.apply(gender_lambda, axis=1)
