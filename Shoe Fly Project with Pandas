# ShoeFly Data Analyst Project

# In this example, you’ll be the data analyst for ShoeFly.com, a fictional online shoe store. You’ve seen this data; now it’s your turn to work with it!
# Load the data from shoefly.csv into the variable orders.

import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

orders = pd.read_csv('shoefly.csv')

# Inspect the first 5 lines of the data.
print(orders.head())

# Select all of the email addresses from the column email and save them to a variable called emails.

emails = orders.email

# Frances Palmer claims that her order was wrong. What did Frances Palmer order?
# Use logic to select that row of orders and save it to the variable frances_palmer.

frances_palmer = orders[(orders.first_name == 'Frances') & (orders.last_name == 'Palmer')]

# We need some customer reviews for our comfortable shoes. 
# Select all orders for shoe_type: clogs, boots, and ballet flats and save them to the variable comfy_shoes.

comfy_shoes = orders[orders.shoe_type.isin(['clogs', 'boots', 'ballet flats'])]
