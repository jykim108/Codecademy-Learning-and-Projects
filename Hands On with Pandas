# Creating Data Frames

# You run an online clothing store called Panda’s Wardrobe. You need a DataFrame containing information about your products.
# Create a DataFrame with the following data that your inventory manager sent you.
# Add the code to create the columns Product Name and Color and their associated data.

import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.DataFrame({
  'Product ID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
  # add Product Name and Color here
  'Product Name': ['t-shirt', 't-shirt', 'skirt', 'skirt'],
  'Color': ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'black']
})

print(df1)

# You can also add data using lists.
# You’re running a chain of pita shops called Pita Power. You want to create a DataFrame with information on your different store locations.
# Use a list of lists to create a DataFrame with the following data.

import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

df2 = pd.DataFrame([
  [1, 'San Diego', 100],
  [2, 'Los Angeles', 120],
  # Fill in rows 3 and 4
  [3, 'San Francisco', 90],
  [4, 'Sacramento', 115]
  ],
  columns=[
    #add column names here
  'Store ID', 'Location', 'Number of Employees'])

print(df2)

# Comma Separate Variables
# You run a cupcake store and want to create a record of all of the cupcakes that you offer.
# Write the following data as a CSV in cupcakes.csv.

name,cake_flavor,frosting_flavor,topping
Chocolate Cake,chocolate,chocolate,chocolate shavings
Birthday Cake,vanilla,vanilla,rainbow sprinkles
Carrot Cake,carrot,cream cheese,almonds

# Loading and Saving CSVs

# You’re working for the County of Whoville and you just received a CSV of data about the different cities in your county. 
# Read the CSV 'sample.csv' into a variable called df, so that you can learn more about the cities.
# Type print(df) on the next line and then run your code. What sort of data were you sent?

import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('sample.csv')
print(df)

# You’re working for a Hollywood studio, trying to use data to predict the next big hit. 
# Load the CSV imdb.csv into a variable called df, so that you can learn about popular movies from the past 90 years.
# Let’s learn about these movies.

import codecademylib3
import pandas as pd

#load the CSV below:

df = pd.read_csv('imdb.csv')
