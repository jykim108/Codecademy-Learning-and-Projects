# Python Lists: Medical Insurance Estimation Project

# The function estimate_insurance_cost() estimates the medical insurance cost for an individual, based on five variables:
'''
age: age of the individual in years
sex: 0 for female, 1 for male
bmi: individual’s body mass index
num_of_children: number of children the individual has
smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker
'''

# Function to estimate insurance cost:
def estimate_insurance_cost(name, age, sex, bmi, num_of_children, smoker):
  estimated_cost = 250*age - 128*sex + 370*bmi + 425*num_of_children + 24000*smoker - 12500
  print(name + "'s Estimated Insurance Cost: " + str(estimated_cost) + " dollars.")
  return estimated_cost
 
# Estimate Maria's insurance cost
maria_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = "Maria", age = 31, sex = 0, bmi = 23.1, num_of_children = 1, smoker = 0)

# Estimate Rohan's insurance cost
rohan_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = 
"Rohan", age = 25, sex = 1, bmi = 28.5, num_of_children = 3, smoker = 0)

# Estimate Valentina's insurance cost
valentina_insurance_cost = estimate_insurance_cost(name = "Valentina", age = 53, sex = 0, bmi = 31.4, num_of_children = 0, smoker = 1)

# Click “Save” to see the estimated insurance costs for three individuals – Maria, Rohan, and Valentina.
# Prints:
'''
Maria's Estimated Insurance Cost: 4222.0 dollars.
Rohan's Estimated Insurance Cost: 5442.0 dollars.
Valentina's Estimated Insurance Cost: 36368.0 dollars.

# We want to compare the estimated insurance costs (as calculated by our function) to the actual amounts that Maria, Rohan, and Valentina paid.
# Create a list called names and fill it with the names of the individuals you are estimating insurance costs for: "Maria", "Rohan", "Valentina"
# Next, create a list called insurance_costs and fill it with the actual amounts that Maria, Rohan, and Valentina paid for insurance: 4150.0, 5320.0, 35210.0

names = ['Maria', 'Rohan', 'Valentina']
insurance_costs = [4150.0, 5320.0, 35210.0]


# Currently the names and insurance_costs lists are separate, but we want each name to be paired with an insurance cost.
# Create a new variable called insurance_data that combines names and insurance_costs using the zip() function. Print this new variable.

insurance_data = zip(names, insurance_costs)
print(list(insurance_data))

# Prints: [('Maria', 4150.0), ('Rohan', 5320.0), ('Valentina', 35210.0)]


# Next, create an empty list called estimated_insurance_data. This is the list we’ll use to store the estimated insurance costs for our three individuals.
# We want to add our estimated insurance data for Maria, Rohan, and Valentina to the estimated_insurance_data list.
# Use .append() to add ("Maria", maria_insurance_cost) to estimated_insurance_data. Do the same for Rohan and Valentina.
# Print estimated_insurance_data. Make sure the output is what you expected.


estimated_insurance_data.append(['Maria', maria_insurance_cost])
estimated_insurance_data.append(['Rohan', rohan_insurance_cost])
estimated_insurance_data.append(['Valentina', valentina_insurance_cost])
print(estimated_insurance_data)

# Prints: [['Maria', 4222.0], ['Rohan', 5442.0], ['Valentina', 36368.0]]


# Add to the print statement for insurance_data so that it’s clear what the list contains. The output of the print statement should look like:
# Here is the actual insurance cost data: [...list output...]
# Do the same for the print statement that prints estimated_insurance_data. The output should look like:
# Here is the estimated insurance cost data: [...list output...]

insurance_data = list(zip(names, insurance_costs))

print('Here is the actual insurance cost data: ' + str(insurance_data))
print('Here is the estimated insurance cost data: ' + str(estimated_insurance_data))

# Prints: 
'''
Here is the actual insurance cost data: [('Maria', 4150.0), ('Rohan', 5320.0), ('Valentina', 35210.0)]
Here is the estimated insurance cost data: [['Maria', 4222.0], ['Rohan', 5442.0], ['Valentina', 36368.0]]

# Compare the estimated insurance data to the actual insurance data. Do the estimated insurance costs seem to be overestimated or underestimated?
# Conclusion: The estimated insurance costs are overestimated compared to the actual insurance costs

# If you’d like additional practice on lists, here are some ways you might extend this project:

# Calculate the difference between the actual insurance cost data and the estimated insurance cost data for each individual.
# Store the results in a list called insurance_cost_difference.

insurance_cost_difference = []

maria_cost_difference = insurance_data[0][1] - estimated_insurance_data[0][1]
rohan_cost_difference = insurance_data[1][1] - estimated_insurance_data[1][1]
valentina_cost_difference = insurance_data[2][1] - estimated_insurance_data[2][1]

insurance_cost_difference.append(['Maria', maria_cost_difference])
insurance_cost_difference.append(['Rohan', rohan_cost_difference])
insurance_cost_difference.append(['Valentina', valentina_cost_difference])
print(insurance_cost_difference)

# Prints: [['Maria', -72.0], ['Rohan', -122.0], ['Valentina', -1158.0]]


# Estimate the insurance cost for a new individual, Akira, who is a 19 year-old male non-smoker with no children and a BMI of 27.1. 
# Make sure to append his name to names and his actual insurance cost, 2930.0, to insurance_costs.
