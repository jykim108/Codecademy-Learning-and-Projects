# Multiple Tables in Pandas Project

# Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. 
# Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.
# Inspect the DataFrames using print and head:
# visits lists all of the users who have visited the website
# cart lists all of the users who have added a t-shirt to their cart
# checkout lists all of the users who have started the checkout
# purchase lists all of the users who have purchased a t-shirt

print(visits.head())
print(cart.head())
print(checkout.head())
print(purchase.head())

# Combine visits and cart using a left merge.
# How long is your merged DataFrame?

visits_and_cart = pd.merge(visits, cart, how='left')
print(len(visits_and_cart))

# How many of the timestamps are null for the column cart_time?
# What do these null rows mean?

carts_are_null = cart['cart_time'].isnull().count()

# What percent of users who visited Cool T-Shirts Inc. ended up not placing a t-shirt in their cart?
# Note: To calculate percentages, it will be helpful to turn either the numerator or the denominator into a float, \
# by using float(), with the number to convert passed in as input. Otherwise, Python will use integer division, which truncates decimal points.
