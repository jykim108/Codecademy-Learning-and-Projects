# Multiple Tables in Pandas Project

# Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. 
# Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.
# Inspect the DataFrames using print and head:
# visits lists all of the users who have visited the website
# cart lists all of the users who have added a t-shirt to their cart
# checkout lists all of the users who have started the checkout
# purchase lists all of the users who have purchased a t-shirt

print(visits.head())
print(cart.head())
print(checkout.head())
print(purchase.head())

# Combine visits and cart using a left merge.
# How long is your merged DataFrame? (yields 2000)

visits_and_cart = pd.merge(visits, cart, how='left')
total_visits = len(visits_and_cart)

# How many of the timestamps are null for the column cart_time? (yields 1652)
# What do these null rows mean?

carts_are_null = len(visits_and_cart[visits_and_cart.cart_time.isnull()])

# What percent of users who visited Cool T-Shirts Inc. ended up not placing a t-shirt in their cart? (yields 82.6%)
# Note: To calculate percentages, it will be helpful to turn either the numerator or the denominator into a float, \
# by using float(), with the number to convert passed in as input. Otherwise, Python will use integer division, which truncates decimal points.

null_cart = carts_are_null / total_visits * 100

# Repeat the left merge for cart and checkout and count null values. 
# What percentage of users put items in their cart, but did not proceed to checkout? (yields ~25.31%)

cart_checkout = pd.merge(cart, checkout, how='left')
total_cart = len(cart_checkout)
null_cart = len(cart_checkout[cart_checkout.checkout_time.isnull()])

percent_null = null_cart / total_cart * 100


# Merge all four steps of the funnel, in order, using a series of left merges. Save the results to the variable all_data.
# Examine the result using print and head.

all_data = visits.merge(cart, how='left').merge(checkout, how='left').merge(purchase, how='left')
print(all_data.head())


# What percentage of users proceeded to checkout, but did not purchase a t-shirt? (yields ~74.79%)

null_checkout = len(all_data[all_data.checkout_time.isnull()])
no_shirt_purchase = null_checkout / len(all_data) * 100

#  Which step of the funnel is weakest (i.e., has the highest percentage of users not completing it)?
# How might Cool T-Shirts Inc. change their website to fix this problem?

null_checkout = len(all_data[all_data.checkout_time.isnull()])
null_cart = len(all_data[all_data.cart_time.isnull()])
null_purchase = len(all_data[all_data.purchase_time.isnull()])

print(null_checkout)
print(null_cart)
print(null_purchase)
# yields 1774, 1652, and 1875 respectively


# Using the giant merged DataFrame all_data that you created, letâ€™s calculate the average time from initial visit to final purchase. 
# Add a column that is the difference between purchase_time and visit_time.
all_data['total_time'] = all_data.purchase_time - all_data.visit_time


# Calculate the average time to purchase by applying the .mean() function to your new column.
average_time = all_data.total_time.mean()
print(average_time)
# yields 0 days 00:43:53.360160
